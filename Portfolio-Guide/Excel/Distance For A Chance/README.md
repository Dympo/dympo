# üèçÔ∏è Distance For A Chance Project

## Objective

This project is used to showcase my Excel skills : extracting information from raw data, cleaning data, and organizing with some conditional formatting.

## Context

In 2015, I embarked on a solo motorcycle adventure around the world to raise money for a school in Indonesia. On my website at the time, I updated my itinerary daily recording the departure city + country, arrival city + country, and the distance covered each day.

The goal of this project is to transform the raw data into a structured format suitable for visualization and further analysis.
