# Travel Insurance Data Analysis 🌍✈️

In this SQL project, I explore a Travel Insurance dataset, clean up data inconsistencies, and perform analysis to answer three key business-related questions. 

            . Which countries do Senior travelers prefer overall?  

            . Which product is most popular for the 35-44 age group?  

            . What is the average duration of travels by age group?
